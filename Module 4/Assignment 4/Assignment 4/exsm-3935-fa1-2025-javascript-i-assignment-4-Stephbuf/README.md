This program is a basic login system where users can register, log in, or quit. Registering requires a new username and a password that’s at least eight characters long. Logging in checks a predefined list of usernames and passwords to make sure the user’s information is correct. If anything is wrong during registration or login, the program shows an error message and stops. Choosing quit simply ends the program with “Goodbye!”.
